# Welcome to my github repository.
In this project I make AgeCalculator by choosing your Date Of Birth via inbuild Callender.

Here we have some ::::: The given code below is [index page](https://github.com/avijadu/WebPage/blob/main/index.html "Simple UI Code").
```<h1>Welcome to my Age calculator</h1>
    <div class="boundry">
        <h3>Date Of Birth</h3>
        <input type="date" name="year" id="DOB" >
        <br><br>
        <button onclick="calculateAge()" style="width: 5rem; height: 2rem;">calculateAge</button><br>    
        <div id="resultContainer"></div>
    </div>
```
We have some simple css property which are added in [style.css](https://github.com/avijadu/WebPage/blob/main/style.css "styling file for Ui").
         
also check [script.js](https://github.com/avijadu/WebPage/blob/main/script.js " dynamic calculation for agecalculator") file for checking how I code for this javascript.
